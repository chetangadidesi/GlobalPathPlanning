# GlobalPathPlanning
A comparative implementation of classic global path planning algorithms — A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS — in Python. Visualizes how each algorithm finds a path from start to goal while navigating around obstacles on a 2D grid map. Built for understanding and benchmarking planning strategies in robotics.
